# SOR4 Sound Replacer

This app only extracts WEM sound files from the Core.bnk and
Generic.bnk files from the SOR4 "data" folder and allows you
to repack them back. You will need additional software.

To convert WEM files to WAV, you'll need either Foobar 2000
or VGMGUI.
* Foobar 2000 - https://www.foobar2000.org/download (you'll
need also need vgmstream
https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases)
* VGMGUI - https://github.com/BENICHN/VGMGUI/releases

To convert WAV or MP3 files back into WEM files, you'll need 
Sound Editor 2018 https://smacktalks.org/forums/topic/68040-sound-editor-2018-released-version-141/
(scroll down to "Download (installer)" and "Reveal hidden contents")
